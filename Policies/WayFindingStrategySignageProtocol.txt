What is wayfinding?

Wayfinding refers to an information system that guides people through a physical
environment. A good system enhances their understanding and experience of the
space and creates a 'sense of place'.
Wayfinding is particularly important for Ulster University due to its varied and
complex campus structures. As each campus develops it becomes more complicated,
so people need visual cues such as maps, directions, and symbols to help guide them
to their destinations. In these often high-stress environments, effective wayfinding
systems contribute to a sense of well-being, safety and security.
A robust wayfinding strategy will help us meet some of the University objectives
in our Professional Services 5&50 Strategy.

Purpose

Principles

Objectives

At all times, students, staff and
visitors should:
– Know where they are.
– Know where they’re going.
– Easily follow the best route to
their destination.
– Recognise their destination
upon arrival.
– Feel confident and reassured.

Signage should:
– Only be used where necessary.
– Be easily noticed.
– Be clear and easy to understand.
– Have a clear hierarchy of information.

A solution befitting of a world-class institution:
– A warm welcome.
– A powerful first and lasting impression.
–	An efficient and rewarding user journey.
– A robust, functional and re-usable system.
–	Consistent across each campus.
– Increase brand recognition.
–	Clear, accessible and inclusive.
–	High quality, ethical and sustainable.
– Help meet the University objectives in our
PS5&50 Strategy.

Why do we Need a Strategy?
4

Signage across Ulster University has been installed on-demand as each campus
has grown and developed. This approach has worked for individual buildings, but not
for the University as a whole. The absence of strategy or guidance has resulted in
a disparate, over-populated set of signs which is confusing for students, staff and
visitors. This inadequate user experience will have a direct, negative impact on the
Ulster University brand.

Inconsistent Messaging
– 10 metres.
– 10 sign types.

Inconsistent Appearance
– Colour.
– Materials.
– Position.
– Colour.
– Scale.
– Finish.

– Labelling.
– Iconography.
– Typefaces.

Why do we Need a Strategy?
5

A clear strategy defines
a consistent approach,
making future signage
efficient and cost-effective.
Crucially, users who
experience a seamless
journey are much more
likely to appreciate their
surroundings and leave
with a positive experience.

Design Solution

We have embarked on a robust design process to conceive a solution that is:
— Future-proof
No superfluous or ephemeral elements.
Interchangeable panels.

— Accessible and readable
High contrast colours. Large sans-serif typeface.
Braille equivalents where appropriate.

— Recognisable
Visually consistent.
Clear association with the university.

— Streamlined
Fewer signs in highly visible, logical locations.

— Cost-effective
Free, open source typeface. Minimal component parts.
Standardised sizes, materials and production techniques.

— Meaningful and usable
	Succinct, firm and polite content. Universal pictograms. Heads-up mapping.
Illustrated landmarks. ‘You are here’ markers with walking radius.

6

Brand Assets

Our wayfinding system is built using our core brand assets: logo, colour and type.
Our system intentionally avoids graphic devices, brand patterns and imagery that
could easily date and distract from our content. Removing all superfluous elements
maximises readability and helps weather future brand identity changes.

Pictograms
Universal, clear and immediate.

New builds and historic buildings
– Same approach across all architectural styles.
– Ensures consistency and reinforces unity.
Use of logo
– External signage: Full logo (May change based on logo plate route).
–	Internal signage: 'U' icon (Maintains brand recognition without
distracting from wayfinding text).
Sign positioning
– All signage should be prominently positioned to be instantly visible.
–	Lighting, reflections, sight lines, vehicles, people and other potential
obstructions should always be considered.
External
– Interchangeable panels for flexibility and longevity.
– Cost-effective to re-skin should the University logo change.
–	Stacked signage is interchangeable to accommodate future changes.
Internal
– No inserts, sliders or other devices that require maintenance.
–	Interchangeable components to accommodate future changes.

8

Language Conventions

Application Principles

Colour
– Single approach across Belfast, Coleraine and Magee campuses.
– A unified approach ensures consistency and builds brand recognition.
–	No internal colour co-ordination, maximising flexibility and
accommodation of layout changes.

Meaningful content
– To be understood quickly, each sign should be as succinct as possible.
–	Providing too much information can cause confusion and can be
easily ignored.
Language
– Abbreviations, technical terms and jargon should be avoided to
minimise confusion.
– Do not use full stops after destination names on signage.
– Terminology and naming should be consistent throughout.
Capitalisation
– Title case (the first letter of each word is capitalised) should be used:
'Main Entrance & Reception' not 'Main entrance & reception'.
– The initial capital creates more recognisable shapes out of words
for improved readability.
– Title case is generally associated with authority and importance,
so is more fitting for wayfinding.
Campus and building naming
–	Buildings should be identified by their code (e.g. 'BA'), until building
names are agreed. Thereafter, all buildings should be referred to by
name, not code.
Braille
– Unified English Braille should be used to the following signage
categories: Welcome / Site Orientation / Level Directories /
Directional / Room Identifiers / Informative.
– Grade 2 Braille should be used for longer descriptions and sentences.
– See p.59 for more detailed applications guidance.

user groups (staff, students, visitors) and their possible
journeys through campus. Users must be supported
throughout their whole journey, from the moment they
arrive to the moment they leave.

Decision Points
Place the appropriate sign at every decision point
(where the navigator must make a wayfinding decision).
For example, whether to continue along the current route
or to change direction.
–	External signage requirements for each campus are
outlined in the following pages.
–	Internal areas should be conducted by staff, with
consideration of user journeys and decision points.

Sample External Journey
Coleraine: Cromore Road to Main Entrance, by car, then on foot.

General Construction
The HB Modular Sign System (MSS) is an elegant, robust
and flexible solution for all internal signing requirements.
The system is made from dovetailed aluminium extrusions
which slide together to form the completed sign. There is
no back plate so signs can be single or double sided.
– Strong and lightweight.
– Interchangeable plates with multiple configurations.
– Plates held securely in place by integral dovetails.
– Only 6mm thick, with no visible frames or fixings.
– Signs can be single or double sided without affecting
the thickness.
– Suitable for wall, door, suspended, projecting, desk
mounted and free-standing signs.
– Incorporates a hidden, tamper-proof locking device.
– No restriction to the size of sign.
– No specialist maintenance required.

Positioning

Raster Braille technique

–	Braille signs are, by their very nature, always read close up and should
be positioned where they can easily be touched. The ideal range of
heights for positioning of Braille signs would be between 1300mm and
1600mm above finished floor level.
–	Braille signage should comply with current Government guildlines.

– Routing and inlay capabilities.
– Coloured or clear ball bearing options.
– Multiple suppliers across Northern Ireland and UK.
– Can be applied to any material, avoiding the need for plastic.

Additional Considerations

Certain wayfinding applications will adapt to meet specific objectives
so may not adhere to our Kit of Parts parameters. Every application
requires justification and advanced approval from the Director of
Estates Services.

Non-Branded Areas

Funder Acknowledgement
64

The University can receive external funding that contributes towards a
new building, project or department – the University may decide to name
these after the donor. This is decided on a case-by-case basis and will be
overseen by the Director of Estates Services.

There may be business or contractual reasons why areas of the
University have their own standalone identity and signage, for example,
Riverside Theatre, Sport Halls, shops, hairdressers and cafés. These
are open to the public and / or self-funded so will manage their own
wayfinding and signage programmes. Please direct any queries to the
Director of Estates Services.

Further Wayfinding
65

Wayfinding extends beyond signage. The user
journey often starts at home – visiting our
website, reading our prospectus, receiving
a email or a phone call with University staff.
To improve the University experience,
every touchpoint should be aesthetically
and verbally cohesive.

Verbal Directions
When giving verbal directions verbally, all language,
names, codes and terminology should be consistent.

Written Communications
Effective wayfinding often starts before reaching
the campus. Pre-visit sources of information such
as web pages, emailers, letters and emails should
utilise consistent language and aesthetics to this
Signage Protocol.

Off-site Signage
There will be some signs outwith the University’s
control that direct people to the University, for
example, street signage. The local authority should be
consulted to ensure the transition from road signage
to campus signage is smooth and that all language and
terminology is consistent.

If this protocol document
does not provide a suitable
solution for your needs, you
must contact the Director of
Estates Services to discuss
and agree best solution before
commissioning any signage.

Signage Protocol Guidelines

Please direct queries and requests to the
Director of Estates Services. Thank you.
