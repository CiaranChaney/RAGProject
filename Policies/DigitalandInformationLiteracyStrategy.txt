Digital and Information Literacy Strategy
2017 - 2021

This Digital and Information Literacy Strategy for 2017-2021 revises and updates the first
Library Information Literacy Strategy, 2012-2015.

The new Strategy builds on the previous Strategy and has been renamed Digital and
Information Literacy Strategy to reflect the importance of developing digital literacies along
with the application of new technologies to support engagement and interactivity in the learning
environment.
The Strategy is aligned to the University’s “Five and Fifty” strategic plan and literacies of the
Library Services Strategy.
The new Strategy emphasises the concept of digital information literacy supported by
application of new and emerging technologies

Executive Summary
Introduction
This strategy document outlines the programme of work to be led by the Digital and Information Literacy (DIL)
Sub Group during the period 2017-2021 in support of academic excellence at Ulster.
This strategy seeks to build on the work of the previous Information Literacy Strategy by continuing to seek new
and innovative ways to deliver Information Literacy support to students and staff. The remit of the strategy has
expanded to take cognisance of the increased use of digital resources and the growing reliance on emerging
technologies by students, and the recognition of the importance of core digital skills for successful study,
employability and lifelong learning.
Digital literacy builds upon traditional information literacy and “goes beyond this to encompass communication,
collaboration and teamwork, social awareness in the digital environment, understanding of e-safety and creation
of new information. Both digital and information literacy are underpinned by critical thinking and evaluation.” 1
The Library Service provides a wide range of information in electronic form and already uses new and emerging
technologies in teaching. In this revised and updated Digital and Information Literacy Strategy, the Library
Service wishes to formalise the development opportunities currently offered to students at all levels. The Strategy
will encourage closer collaboration between academic staff and subject librarians in order to support and improve
integration of digital and information skills into university programmes through increased incorporation of digital
technologies and active learning approaches in library teaching, in keeping with the University’s student learning
experience principles and emerging pedagogic approaches to learning and teaching at Ulster.
Context
The importance of digital and information literacy is recognised not only by those working in the information field
but also by employers, professional associations and the Government as an important graduate attribute that is
applicable to study, employment and lifelong learning.
The development of digital literacy skills forms one of the six Student Experience Principles to equip students “for
living, learning, communicating and working in a digital world and to maximize their employability”. 2
This strategy aims to build upon the former information literacy strategy with the development of core digital
literacy skills, encouraging the increased use of technologies in delivering information literacy skills sessions,
facilitating flexible approaches and embracing the concept of technology-enhanced learning. It also aims to
promote the critical importance of digital and information literacy especially in the context of university learning
and teaching to:




Identify the digital and information literacy competencies students require in order to benefit fully from
their research and studies. The competencies can be consulted on the Digital and Information Literacy
Skills online guide at http://guides.library.ulster.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=31385520
Demonstrate ways in which these competencies can be acquired in a discipline-specific context
Collaborate with academic colleagues in improving digital literacy skills.

The Strategy aligns to the following University Strategies

Key dependencies
For a Digital and Information Literacy Strategy to be adopted and embedded, it requires both institutional and
faculty commitment. The vision is for a university where digital and information literacy learning opportunities are
fully integrated into the academic curriculum in a timely and relevant manner and where subject librarians and
academic staff are partners in ensuring that all students have the opportunity to gain these critical lifelong
independent learning skills. The Library already works collaboratively across a broad range of business areas to
include academic staff, Research and Impact, Staff Development, Access, Digital and Distributed Learning and
the International Department to support the delivery of digital and information literacy to all users.
Digital and information literacy, vision, mission and values.
The Digital and Information Literacy Strategy fully supports the Library Service’s vision and mission, and
embraces the same values and guiding principles.
The goal of this strategy is to ensure that all Ulster students, regardless of mode of study, are enabled to become
digitally and information literate through the provision of effective digital and information literacy learning and
teaching opportunities.
This supports the Library’s vision to transform the experience of our users through excellence in the provision
and development of sustainable library services and resources. Digital and information literacy support at Ulster
is also a bench marker, which can be used for comparison with other universities.
The Strategy
This strategy sits under the Library Services Strategy as a flexible and agile document, which will respond to
changes in the operating environment as required. It will be reviewed annually by the Library Management Team
to ensure it adequately supports the Library Services Strategy and meets the needs of stakeholders.
Strategic Priorities
The strategy will be operationalised through the delivery of an annual work plan and associated Key Performance
Indicators.
Building on the above has led to the development of three strategic priorities which are the key performance
areas against which the library will seek to deliver its DIL Skills programme in the period 2017/8 – 2020/1.
SP1 To deliver digital and information literacy skills in support of learning and teaching
SP2 To deliver enhanced digital and information literacy skills in support of Ulster’s research community.
SP3 To provide digital and information literacy support for widening participation access at regional, national
and international levels.
The following overarching and enabling objectives underpin the delivery of the strategy
EO1 To promote digital and information literacy provision and deliver evidence of impact.
EO2 To develop and optimise the library’s physical and virtual presence in line with new pedagogic approaches
to learning and teaching, facilitating collaboration using active learning spaces and technologies such as
Blackboard Collaborate and Nearpod.
EO3 To develop and support library staff to deliver the digital and information literacy.
Delivering the strategy
Each strategic priority has a number of supporting objectives aligned to it. The Digital and Information Literacy
Sub Group will deliver an annual implementation plan, detailing activities and projects based on the supporting
objectives to operationalize the strategy. The Digital and Information Literacy Sub Group will have oversight of
the plan and monitor its progress, reporting to the Library Management Team on a regular basis.
