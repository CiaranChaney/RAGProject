UUSU Political Expression Framework
As a member-led organisation which exists to support and represent all of our students, UUSU belongs
to all students and is committed to promoting good relations on campus.
The purpose of this document is to lay out the minimum expectations of behaviour from all of our
members, and their guests, whilst engaging with political debates and engagement under the
umbrella of UUSU. It should be read in conjunction with the UUSU Good Relations policy and is written
to compliment the values and aims encompassed within this document.
The focus of the framework is to encourage behaviour that promotes a diversity of views and robust,
responsible political debate. This framework provides guidelines to ensure that such debate is
conducted in a manner in which individuals recognise that others are entitled to have a view, whether
or not it is contrary to their own.
Expressing Political Opinion
Typical areas where political expression may be encountered include (but not restricted to):
•

Events organised by political parties

This list is not exhaustive. In order to ensure that political expression occurs safely and freely at the
University, the Students’ Union expects students to be mindful of the following:
•

•
•

Diversity of opinion: You should expect that you will be in an environment where not everyone
agrees with you and/or where you do not agree with everyone; others will not necessarily
agree with your expression and their rights will also need to be protected;
Inclusion: Every member of a community should feel that they are at liberty to attend any
event, if they so wish;
Developing political societies: In the spirit of the Good Relations Policy, members are
requested to respect the views and feelings of fellow students and staff. It is important that
every society committee take responsibility for promoting good relations within the University
at all times. It is recommended that society officers liaise regularly with UUSU staff in this
regard.

Organising Political Events or Visits
All events must align with the Students’ Union Good Relations Policy. For Health and Safety and
planning purposes, it is important that the organiser discusses the intended event or visit with a UUSU
representative, prior to the event. They should also refer to the guidance on organising political
events. UUSU will be able to provide all relevant guidance in relation to event planning. The University
Provost has ultimate authority in approving events and visits on University premises.

Complaints
If there is a perceived breach of any of the above, in the first instance students should write to the
President of UUSU: president@uusu.org
Where the complaint involves the President, please contact the Chief Executive Officer of UUSU –
d.longstaff@ulster.ac.uk
