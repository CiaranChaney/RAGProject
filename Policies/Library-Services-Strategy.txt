1. Executive Summary

The previous Library Services Strategy provided a framework to shape the development of the
Library Service on improving and developing the range of services and facilities available to users
The Library Service Strategy for 2016-2021 will continue the work of transforming the Library
Service and will use innovative and transformational technology where possible and appropriate
to deliver services. Service to users will remain at the heart of the Strategy, user expectations
and satisfaction levels with access to information resources, services and space will be monitored
and assessed on an ongoing basis and will inform the delivery of strategic objectives.
The Library Strategic Plan is structured and aligned to deliver against the Institutional Strategic
Plan, SP 5&50. This is a key driver and will influence the development and delivery of library
services during the lifecycle of the Strategy.
The transition to a digital library environment in integral to the Strategic Plan. In order for this
critical facet of the Strategy to be implemented effectively, a significant cultural shift will be
required to enable users to benefit from the opportunities of accessing information resources at a
time, place and pace of their choosing in support of flexible modes of learning.
Six strategic priorities have been identified along with three enabling objectives. Together, these
will form the key performance areas in which the Library will seek to deliver against in the planning
timeframe of 2016 -2021.

Each Strategic Priority has a number of supporting objectives aligned to it. The Library Service
will operationalise the Strategy through the delivery an annual implementation plan comprising
projects derived from the supporting objectives. The Library's Priorities Oversight Group will
determine and prioritise the content of the annual implementation plan during the lifecycle of the
Strategy and the plan will be submitted to the Library Management Team for formal approval.
The Business Improvement Forum will capture, discuss, document and agree proposals for work
on new or improved business processes that will enhance the user experience and/or improve
library efficiency. These proposals will be passed to the Library Priorities Oversight Group for
further consideration.
The Library is committed to a process of continuous service improvement and will strive to deliver
service excellence in a rapidly changing environment.
2. Introduction

This document articulates the direction and broad programme of work that will be undertaken by
the Library Service at Ulster over a five-year timeframe, 2016 to 2021. The Library Services
Strategy will seek to build upon and continue the process of modernising and transforming the
Library Service that was initiated during the life cycle of the previous strategy. The Strategy will
continue to be focused on the delivery of a superior user experience through the provision of
innovative, sustainable, technology-led, user-focused services for the university community.
The Library is a user-centric, core, overarching professional service with a remit to support all
aspects of University life; as such it plays a pivotal role in supporting learning, teaching and
research at Ulster and delivering against the aspirations of the institutional strategy. The value of
the professional service and expertise delivered by Library staff, coupled with the quality of the
information resources, services and space available to users is reflected in both internal and
external metrics. For three consecutive years the Library has achieved a year on year increase
in NSS scores with a score consistently above sector average. In the NSS survey for 2015-16,
the Library achieved a 90% satisfaction rate with resources and services. This external metric
makes an important and significant contribution to the positive reputation of the Institution. Library
staff continue to avail of opportunities to engage in personal and professional development with
the attainment of qualifications such as the PgCHEP award and external professional recognition
of their support for learning and teaching via the Higher Education Academy.
3. Context

The external operating environment for Higher Education continues to deliver considerable
challenges for the sector as a whole. The requirement to address changes in the sector, not least
significant reductions in funding whilst striving to maintain a quality offering of services against
this, is being addressed at institutional level at Ulster and includes a review of both the academic
and professional services structures. The review will ensure that Ulster can meet and deliver on
the challenges that lie ahead with a sustainable offering of information resources, support and
services. It is also important to acknowledge the impact of policy changes in the Higher Education
sector on the student experience and in particular the changed expectations and perceptions of
students in relation to the totality of the student experience. New external challenges are emerging

such as the development of a Teaching Excellence Framework with an increased focus on
monitoring and assessing the quality of teaching in Higher Education. In addition, the obligation
to meet the requirements of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the context of Open
Access and Research Data Management will have a significant impact on service delivery. In
this context, it is essential that the Library Service engages in horizon-scanning to keep abreast
of trends and issues affecting academic libraries, and deliver a proactive, responsive service to
all library users.
A new organisational strategy has emerged based around four core priorities:
•
•
•
•

Academic excellence
Global vision
Civic contribution
Operational excellence.

The Library is well placed to support and enable these institutional priorities given that the
previous Library Services Strategy had focused on service delivery in these key areas which have
been identified as core dimensions of Ulster's Institutional Strategy.
The delivery of a quality service to all stakeholders, students, academic and administrative staff
and registered external users, is the primary focus of the Library Services Strategy. The revised
and updated Strategy will reinforce the leading role that the Library plays in the provision of
information resources and services to support excellence in learning, teaching, research and
administration across the Institution and in benefiting the wider community. The Library Service
will continue to focus on delivering an excellent user experience and exceeding user expectation
with access to digital information resources and services alongside the provision of creative,
collaborative flexible learning spaces that will meet the needs of the twenty-first century academic
library user.
The Library Service makes a significant and valuable contribution to the external reputation of the
University and its offering to current and potential students. The Strategy will affirm the Library's
lead role in support of the University's strategy, its values and delivering an enhanced student
experience at Ulster University.
The Library Services Strategy will align to the institutional strategy and a number of other existing
strategies to include:
•
•
•
•

The Learning and Teaching Strategy
Digital Futures Strategy
Research and Impact Strategy
Internationalisation Strategy.

The Strategy will also take into consideration a number of broad themes which will impact on
library service delivery during the next five years:
•

The changing learning landscape

•
•
•

The utilisation and impact of space on learning with particular focus on the provision of
collaborative and group study spaces
The focus on globalization
lnterdisciplinarity in research and teaching.

During the timeframe of the Strategy, the greatest challenge will be planning for the transition to
the new campus at Greater Belfast. The delivery of library services in this new environment has
influenced the planning and preparation for new models of service delivery to meet current and
future user expectations. Library staff are central to the operationalisation of the strategy and as
such it is imperative that the Library Service continues to invest in staff training and development
to maintain the Library's reputation for excellence in the delivery of service to users.
4. Key Dependencies
Given the centrality of the Library's role in supporting all aspects of academic life at Ulster, the
importance of effective partnership, communication and collaboration with internal stakeholders
and business partners cannot be overestimated.
A key business relationship exists between the Library Service and the Information Services
Department. The Library is wholly dependent on a robust, agile and responsive university-wide
Information Technology Strategy to support the delivery of technology-enhanced Library Services
and enable the Library Service to achieve its strategic objectives in this respect.
In addition, the Library Service works collaboratively with a wide range of internal business areas
to include the International Office, Student Administration, Student Support, Finance, Research
and Impact, Physical Resources, Access, Digital and Distributed Learning and Staff Development
to support the delivery of a quality service to all users. The Library will also contribute as and
when required to the development of new institutional initiatives such as the Student Services
Centre.
5. The Library's Vision

To transform the experience of our users through excellence in the provision and development of
sustainable library services and resources.
6. The Library's Mission statement

To develop, deliver and sustain library services and resources to support the University in
achieving its aims.
7. The Library's Values Statement
The following values statement reflects the core values and standards which shape and define
service delivery in the Library at Ulster.
The Library aims to:
•

Be enthusiastic and responsive to all users through the provision of high-quality
personalised services

9. The Strategy

By default, the Library Services Strategy is a flexible and agile document which will respond to
changes in the internal and wider operating environments as required. An annual review process
through Senate will ensure that the Strategy remains fit for purpose, will meet evolving institutional
needs and reflects all aspects of wider operational excellence in learning, teaching and research.
10. Strategic Priorities

11. Funding the strategy

The Library Service at Ulster is dependent on central university funding for its income. The most
recent figures available via SCONUL show that the Library was funded to the value of 3.6% of
total institutional expenditure in 2015-16, which is comparable to Libraries of similar size and
structure with which Ulster is benchmarked. Central funding represents 97% of total Library
income, the remainder is largely accrued through fines income and donations from the Ulster
Fund.
In order to deliver on its strategic objectives, it is incumbent upon the Library Service to ensure
that spending is aligned to strategic objectives. A particular focus going forward will be delivering
a shift in the balance of expenditure from lesser used print resources towards enhancing and
developing the range of provision of information in electronic format.

Appendix A
Key deliverables from the Library Services Strategy 2012/13-2015/16
The Library Services Strategy (2012/13 - 2015/16) emerged following a period of organisational
restructuring and was developed to provide direction for the Library Service in order to position
the service to meet and exceed the expectations of users in terms of the services, information
resources and the support required to underpin learning, teaching and research in a rapidly
changing information environment.
The institutional aspiration to deliver a modern digitally-enabled campus at GBD required the
development of a Library Strategy with a focus to accelerate the development of electronic access
to services and effect a strategic shift towards the increased delivery of information in electronic
formats to support a flexible, anytime anywhere approach to learning and research.
Whilst the strategy was time-limited, the deliverables were intended to position the Library Service
to meet current institutional needs and future-proof the Library Service at Ulster well into the next
decade and beyond.
Over the timeframe of the Strategy, user satisfaction with the Library Service has increased year
on year with the National Student Survey (NSS) score for the Library rising from 88% in the 201213 academic year to 90% in the 2015-16 academic year, this is well above the sector average of
87%.
The implementation of the LibQUAL +® Lite user perception survey in 2013 indicated that overall,
satisfaction with the library service is at its highest level since the survey was first implemented in
2005. The Library achieved a mean score of 7.4 out of 9 in terms of general satisfaction with the
Service.
Services to users

A significant number of new and improved library services have been introduced to deliver an
enhanced and enriched user experience of the Library Service. Key Performance Indicators
measure the effectiveness of key aspects of service delivery in core business areas to ensure
that the Library is meeting and exceeding its objectives in terms of service delivery to users.
The high standards of service that users can expect from the Library Service are clearly articulated
in the revised and updated Library Services Charter which was approved in 2016.
The following provides a synopsis of the new and improved services that have been introduced
during the lifecycle of the Strategy.
•
•
•

The Introduction of LibGuides, a new, multi-media approach to help users to identify the best
information resources to support their subject area

Staff Development

An overarching and enabling objective of the 2012/13-2015/16 strategy was to develop the
capability of staff at all levels to support service development and enhance the quality of service
delivery to users. The CPPD Sub Group of the Library Management Team took the lead on
developing this aspect of the Strategy with a holistic approach to identifying the training needs of
Library staff.
